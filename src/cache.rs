//! Local SQLite cache for folders, message summaries, and bodies.
//!
//! The cache lets the app show mail instantly on startup, read offline, and
//! avoid re-fetching message bodies. Each per-account worker opens its own
//! connection (so the `!Send` `rusqlite::Connection` never crosses threads);
//! WAL mode keeps concurrent access from contending. Everything is keyed by
//! account so two accounts can both have an "INBOX". It is strictly
//! best-effort: any error is logged and degrades to "no cache".

/// Bump when the table layout changes; older rows are dropped on open.

/// v9: re-decode subjects cached as raw RFC 2047 encoded-words by builds that
/// aborted on over-long encoded-words (e.g. Mailchimp newsletters).
/// v10: bodies are re-rendered with `cid:` image references resolved to `data:`
/// URIs, so cached bodies showing a broken image must be dropped and rebuilt.
/// v11: sender authentication is computed from the raw message at the same
/// moment the body is rendered, so dropping `bodies` re-fetches both together
/// and every cached message gains a verdict.
/// v12: plain-text bodies no longer bake `padding:16px` into the cached
/// document — the reader injects the default inset at render time — so cached
/// bodies carrying the old baked padding must be dropped and re-rendered.
/// v13: builds before the declared-attachment exemption dropped small files a
/// web-Gmail sender attached, and stored one blob copy per Gmail label. The
/// checked table remembers those messages as done, so the wrong lists would
/// survive forever — drop both tables and let attachments re-fetch on demand.
/// v14: `attachment_meta`/`attachment_scan` for the gallery — purely additive,
/// so nothing cached is dropped for it (see [`RENDER_VERSION`]).
/// v15: the first attachment scan wrote off a whole batch when one message's
/// BODYSTRUCTURE would not parse, so up to 200 messages were recorded as
/// holding nothing when several held files. Messages marked as scanned with
/// nothing to show are re-queued once, to be asked about again by the scan that
/// now isolates the one message at fault.
/// v19: the message is also read for a meeting invitation (its
/// `text/calendar` part, #223), which rides with the sender check — and a
/// calendar part now counts as an attachment, which the stored attachment
/// lists and "already scanned" marks predate.
/// v18: the unsubscribe scan now reads the body as well as the headers
/// (a footer link, a mailto link, "reply with UNSUBSCRIBE"), so a verdict
/// stored by an earlier build knows only what its headers said.
/// v17: the sender check now carries the message's unsubscribe handles
/// (List-Unsubscribe, RFC 8058), read from the raw headers at the fetch. A
/// check stored by an earlier build knows nothing of them, and a cached
/// body is served without ever re-fetching — so the derived tables are
/// dropped once and every message read again gains its Unsubscribe banner.
/// v20: sender names and subjects were stored with the backslash escapes of
/// the server's quoted string, and a name with the header's own quotes
/// around it (#312). The rows are cleaned in place, see
