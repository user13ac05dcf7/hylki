//! Left pane: an optional "All Inboxes" (unified) row, then one section per
//! account. Each account has a colored avatar circle + header button (chevron
//! on the right) and an animated `gtk::Revealer` holding its folder list, so
//! expanding/collapsing slides smoothly. Exactly one thing is selected across
//! the unified row and all account folder lists.
//!
//! Account order is managed in the Accounts window, not here; folder order is
//! set here (a folder dragged between its siblings) and handed to the app to keep, which sends it back in `SectionData`. Collapse state is
//! owned by the app (persisted); collapse is animated locally and reported for
//! persistence WITHOUT a full rebuild (which would interrupt the animation).
